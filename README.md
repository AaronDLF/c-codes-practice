# C Codes Practice

A monorepo of C projects for practicing and learning the language through different exercises and applications.

## Structure

This repository contains multiple independent projects, each in its own directory:

- **random-walker**: Random walk simulation with multiple agents moving stochastically across the screen.
- **function-plotter**: Mathematical function plotter that uses tinyexpr to evaluate expressions and render them on a cartesian plane.
- **bouncy-ball-animation**: Physics simulation of a bouncing ball with gravity and trajectory tracing.

## Building

Each project is compiled independently from its directory. Check the source files for specific build instructions and dependencies.

## Running

Each project has its own way of running. Consult the source files to see the specific parameters for each one.
